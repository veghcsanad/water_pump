# water_pump

Our project plan is implementing a water pump troubleshooting guide for a nuclear power plant. The expert knowledge will come from Teo's dad who works at a power plant. In the domain, rule and problem-solving models there is an implementation of one very basic function. If the water pump is making a noise, the supplier of the water pump should be called. This is just an example of how we plan to build up our knowledge bases. The main file contains the "hello world" program.
